# Parcel
- Dev build generation
- Local Server
- HMR - Hot Module Replacement 
- File watching algorithm - written in C++
- Caching
- Image Optimization
- Minification
- Bundling
- Compression
- Code Splitting
- Tree Shaking - remove unused code
- HTTPS - SSL support
- Beautiful diagnostics & error reporting
- Differential Bundling - Support for legacy browsers 
- Consistent Hashing - Means that the same file will always have the same name, allowing for better caching. Also, if you change a file, only that file will have a different name, so the browser will only download that file. This is a huge improvement over the traditional way of bundling, where every file has a different name every time you change something, so the browser has to download everything again.
- Automatic Polyfilling - Parcel automatically detects which browsers your users are using and only sends the necessary polyfills. This means that your users will download less code, and your app will load faster.
- Production Builds - Parcel can create production builds with code minification and asset optimization out of the box, no need to install additional plugins or bundles.s
